    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This makes a lovely alternative to the much more common corned beef and cabbage that you may have been planning for St. Patrick's Day dinner.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon butter</li>
        <li>1 onion, diced</li>
        <li>2 pounds lean ground lamb</li>
        <li>⅓ cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons minced fresh rosemary</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon paprika</li>
        <li>⅛ teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon ketchup</li>
        <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>2 ½ cups water, or as needed</li>
        <li>1 (12 ounce) package frozen peas and carrots, thawed</li>
        <li>2 ½ pounds Yukon Gold potatoes, peeled and halved</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon butter</li>
        <li>1 pinch ground cayenne pepper</li>
        <li>¼ cup cream cheese</li>
        <li>¼ pound Irish cheese (such as Dubliner®), shredded</li>
        <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>1 egg yolk</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons milk</li>
        
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
            <li>Place olive oil and butter in Dutch oven over medium heat. Stir in onion and ground lamb; brown the meat, breaking it up into small crumbles as it cooks, about 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Stir in flour until incorporated, then mix in salt, black pepper, rosemary, paprika, cinnamon, ketchup, and garlic; cook and stir until garlic is fragrant, 2 to 3 minutes.</li>
            <li>Stir in water and scrape up any brown bits from the bottom of the Dutch oven. Reduce heat to medium-low and bring mixture to a simmer; cook and stir until thick, about 5-6 minutes.</li>
            <li>Remove lamb mixture from heat and stir in peas and carrots until combined.</li>
            <li>Spread lamb mixture into the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish and set aside.</li>
            <li>Place potatoes into a large pan of salted water. Bring to a boil, reduce heat to medium, and cook until tender, about 15 minutes. Drain well and return potatoes to pan.</li>
            <li>Mash butter, cayenne pepper, cream cheese, and Irish cheese into the potatoes. Mash until combined and potatoes are smooth. Season to taste with salt and black pepper.</li>
            <li>Whisk together egg yolk and milk in a small bowl; stir into the mashed potato mixture.</li>
            <li>Top the lamb mixture in the baking dish with the mashed potatoes and spread evenly to cover.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until the top is golden brown and sauce is bubbling up around the edges, 25 to 30 minutes.    </li>

    </ol>
